# Examples

developer.

## Add an example

If you'd like to submit an example, make sure it hasn't been proposed yet. To get started, create your new example on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), test it and make sure it works as
expected. When it's ready, open a PR to add it on this folder (we recommend you create the example for both JavaScript and TypeScript, but that's not required).

Also, don't forget to add a Usage example and the component on the file.
